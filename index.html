       HTML Let us tell you that it`s a fairly easy task. HTML without styling can`t do anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table or creating a fram - but it is handy

    <p>Tag are what you`ll see in the most when you look at any HTML source code. A tag can ideally bee seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document. Tags tell what magic
      is to be done on a content enclosed by them.
    </p>
  
    <p>Let`s look at two types of tags.</p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>&lttag-example-1>I need a closing tag &lttag-example-1&gt</li>
      <li>&lttag-example-2&gtI don`t need a closing tag.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In the first example the sentence is wrapped in two tags. The first one is called opening tag and the second one is called as closing tag. Everything in betwwen affected
      by the property of tag. every commenly used examples of such tags are &lthtml&gt, &ltbody&gt,&lthead&gt,&ltstrong&gt, etc.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      the seconde tag about longer tags,- as,in they don`t need a closing tag to function. Althought it`s not required, this type of tag are often written as to make the 
      debugging of code easier commenly example of sunch tags are &lthr&gt -used for hrizontal line , &ltbr/&gt -used for braek line etc. 
    </p>
  
    <h2> Step Two-HTML,HEAD,and BODY: The three pillars of your document</h2>
  
    <img src = "../6.jpg" alt = "sorry"><br>
  
    <p>This tags are essential for any HTML documents. They parcel out the significant of your HTML code.</p>
  
    <ul type ="disc">
      
      <li> &ltBODY&gt&lt/BODY&gt tag is palced below your &lthead&gt tag, and every thing that you want to be display on the screen come under this tag text, image ,link and pretty
        much anything you can see in your browser live inside the tag.
      </li>
  
      <li>&ltHTML&gt&ltHTML/&gt wrapped your entire code. Enything else in your HTML documnet need to come inside this tag.</li>
  
      <li>&ltHEAD&gt&lt/HEAD&lt include thing like title,style, and script had usally present in the top (hah!) just inside the &lt/HTML&gt.</li>
  
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Step three - A few tags hat`all make your page pretty.</h2>
  
    <p>Now you that know how to set up the skelaton of your document. let`s proceed with the things thst will go inside your &ltBODY&gt tag and do some magic!.</p>
    <p>Some basic text formating tags.</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>&ltb&gt&lt/b&gt make your taxt look <b>bold</b></li>
      <li>&lti&gt&lti&gt make your text cursive</li>
      <li>&ltu&gt&lt/u&gt <u>underline</u> what just you written.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, the piece of code:</p>
  <hr>
  
  <pre>
    &lthtml&gt
         
          &lthead&gt&lt/head&gt
  
          &ltbody&gt
  
           &lti&gt I am italics! &lt/i&gt &ltbr&gt
           &ltb&gt I am bold! &lt/b&gt &ltbr&gt
           &ltu&gt And me?, well I`m underline! &lt/u&gt &ltbr&gt
         &lt/body&gt
         
    &lt/html&gt
    <hr>
  
  </pre>
  
  <img src ="../7.png" alt ="sorry">
  
  <h3>Tags to help your structure and content:</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>&ltbr&gt Break the line, make you to continue from next line.</li>
    <li>&ltp&gt  Stand for paragraph. It divide your content in paragraph.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <note><i>Note: You need to use this tags as space and enter key do very little when it come to formating content isside the HTML document.</i></note>
  
  <h3>Heading tags:</h3>
  
  <p>HTML provide you with six tags: from &ltH1&gt&lt/H1&gt to  &ltH6&gt&lt/H6&gt to help you creat different size header quickly.</p>
  
  <img src ="../8.png" alt ="soory"><br>
  
  <h3>Inserting An Image:</h3>
  
  <p>All that`s good but what fun without image on the webpage? Don`t worry, &ltIMG&gt, to the rescue!. The image tag is mandotary attribute called <q>source</q>
    Basically, it tells the browser where should you look for the image . the syntax goes somthing like.
  </p>
  
  <i>&ltimg src ="path_to_your_image" /&gt</i>
  
  <p>Further more, it also has attribute like heigth and width that let you specify the height and width you want to our image take.</p>
  
  <h3>List:</h3>
  
  <p>HTML has two types of list -ordered and unordered. Each item of your list has to be inclosed in a tag. The syntax of craeting is fairly simple.</p>
  
  <p>Suppose you want to creat a list like: </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The following code wiil do easily job for you </p>
  <hr>
  
  <pre>
    &ltul&gt
       &ltl&gtItem 1&lt/l&gt
       &ltl&gtItem 2&lt/l&gt
       &ltl&gtItem 3&lt/l&gt
    &lt/ul&gt
    <hr>   
  
  </pre>
  
  <p>This, by the way was an example on unordered list. For an ordered list, all you need to do replace &ltul&gt with &ltol&gt and &lt/ul&gt with &lt/ol&gt.</p>
  <p>Let`s see what the following code does.</p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <pre>
  &lthtml&gt
      
      &lthead&gt&lt/head&gt
  
      &ltbody&gt
       
       &ltul&gt
        &ltl&gt I am unordered list`s item 1! &lt/l&gt
        &ltl&gt I am unordered list`s item 2! &lt/l&gt
        &ltl&gt I am unordered list`s item 3! &lt/l&gt
      &lt/ul&gt
  
      &ltol&gt
        &ltl&gt I am ordered list`s item 1! &lt/l&gt
        &ltl&gt I am ordered list`s item 2! &lt/l&gt
        &ltl&gt I am ordered list`s item 3! &lt/l&gt
      &lt/ol&gt
    
    &lt/body&gt
    
  &lt/html&gt
  </pre>
  
  <hr>
